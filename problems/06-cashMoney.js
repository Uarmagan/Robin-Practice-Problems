/* 
Excercise 6:
------------------------------
Write a function that takes an array of strings. 
If the first letter of a word contains the letter S, 
then swap that letter out with a $. 
Return that array with all the first letters that are S's swapped for $'s

for example:
([Sally, sat, on, the, pig]) => [$ally, $at, on, the, pig] 
([wow, pat, found, cat, silly, storm, boy]) => [wow, pat, found, cat, $illy, $torm, boy]
*/

// export function cashMoney(arr) {}

//BONUS:
// go through the array and replace every letter s that you find with a $
